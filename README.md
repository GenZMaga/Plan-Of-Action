# MAGA Plan of Action ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

This repository contains a single file called `planOfAction.md`. Our task as Maga is to collaborate and come up with great strategies to secure a MAGA Victory.

### Why?
With the recent announcement of V.P. Kamala Harris as the Dem. Presidential Nominee, MAGA has gotten complacent. We've stopped fighting like we did with Biden. This puts us at jeopardy since Kamala is making real gains on Trump and is a better candidate than Biden for the Democrats. With the help of fellow MAGA, we should be able to propose a detailed plan of action that would all but guarantee Trumps victory in the 2024 elections.

### Contribution Guidelines
If you wish to contribute, you need to create an `Issue` using the Issues tab on the top left. You'll have 2 templates to choose from:
1. Amend an existing plan point (you use then when you want to amend an existing plan; must provide logical reasoning as to why your plan is better)
2. Create a new plan point (you can use then when you want to create a new plan; again, you need to provide logical reasoning as to why your plan is better)

Your issue must be chosen from the two templates. If your issue(s) doesn't contain a tag in the template, it'll be automatically removed.

Contributors with multiple good plans will be give the role of a `Collaborator` and they'll be able to make changes without the persmission of the repo owner.
