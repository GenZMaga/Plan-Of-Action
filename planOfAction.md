# Plan Of Action

This file contains the tentative plan of action to recommend to the Trump War Room to implement. Feel free to point out inconsistencies and suggest improvements!

You need to read the README before you contribute.

## PLANS
1. Replace JD Vance as the VP Nominee 2 days after Kamala's VP announcement. The new Rep. VP Nominee needs to be a woman (recommend Tulsi Gabbard)
  - JD Vance has alienated a large proportion of the American voter base
  - JD Vance does not appeal to many Republicans let alone the Moderates and the Democrats
  - Doing it 2 days after Kamala's announcement makes sure that our VP stays in the limelight
  - Tulsi has also served in the military
  - She's a woman (appeals to the very voter base that JD Vance has alienated)
  - She has a history of debating against Kamala and winning
2. Secure a temporary hiatus in Israeli counterattack. Make it contingent on Netanyahu announcing Trump's efforts in securing such a peace deal.
  - Many care about the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict
  - Securing a peace treaty where others such as Biden and Kamala have failed would increase confidence in Trump's medatorial capabilities
  - This can go long ways in securing the votes from people sympathetic to both the Israeli and the Palestinian cause
3. Highlight the difference in economies from 2019 to today
  - Showcase the difference in Fuel prices
  - Showcase the difference in Grocery prices
  - We have largely forgotten how better it used to be in terms of the economy
4. Highlight Kamala's role as Border Czar
  - Highlight how she bottled her handling of the border
  - Highlight how she just visited the border for viewing points without implementing any real change
  - Highlight the migrant numbers since her role as a Border Czar
... and much more
