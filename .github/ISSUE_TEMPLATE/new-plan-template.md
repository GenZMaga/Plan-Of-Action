## Plan Summary

## Reasoning
1.

3.
...

Your logical reasoning should be a deductive reasoning statement that allows a reader to quickly understand why we should implement your plan. For example:

1. Trump should secure a temporary peace plan with Netanyahu contingent on him publicly citing Trump's peace efforts.
2. This plan is good because securing a ceasefire would highlight Trump's mediatorial skills and highlight his interest in securing peace.
3. This would encourage a large voter base of both sides to vote for him thus improving his odds.
4. Given these benefits, this plan must be adopted.

Your reasoning should look similar. You must mention what your plan would do and how it would help secure a Republican victory.
